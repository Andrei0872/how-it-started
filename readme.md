# How it started

This repo contains a lot of memories from the beginning of my programming career. It all started when a teacher unexpectedly told me once: *Wow, you're really mastering it*. It happened while trying to wrap my head around *recursion*. This is the moment in which my journey began. I'm thankful to everybody who contributed, contributes and will contribute to my journey of becoming a better person and a better developer.

At the beginning I used to spend a lot of time on solving algorithms, so there will be a dedicated directory in which I'll add the first problems that I solved, along with the file's creation date.

I'll also add a few of my first projects I ever made. They don't bring much value, but they mean a lot to me.
