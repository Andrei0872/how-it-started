# Catalog scolar

This is my first *real* web project that I ever made. I collaborated with a high school classmate on this and I remember that I wont my first money(40 lei = <10 euro) from programming with the help of this project. I can't help but mention the incredible help that I got from my mentor back then, to whom I'm very thankful.

From this project I learnt that security is an important aspect of app development(I've learned that because an SQL injection occurred during the presentation in front of the jury).
